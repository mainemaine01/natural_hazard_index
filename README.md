Germaine PÃ¶tgen

Abstract

Natural hazard analyses are a crucial component in supporting decision-making regarding disaster risk reduction. Given the increasing challenges posed by climate change and the associated multiple hazards, it is crucial to provide free and standardized software for natural hazard analysis in order to give the broadest possible user base the opportunity to assess these hazards. Accordingly, in the course of this work, based on a detailed literature search, a script for determining the hazard index for any location according to Owen et al. (2023) is created and made freely available. This script is based on remote sensing data with global data consistency and is characterized by reliable, fast and uncomplicated application. An exemplary use of the created script in the context of this work and the analysis of the results obtained from it, underlines the applicability of the script and confirms the plausibility of the chosen method.
